A simple header-only C++ library for reading and writing audio files.

Current supported formats:

- WAV

## Usage

### Create an AudioFile object:

    #include "AudioFile.h"

    AudioFile<double> audioFile;

### Load an audio file:

    audioFile.load ("/path/to/my/audiofile.wav");

### Get some information about the loaded audio:

    int sampleRate = audioFile.getSampleRate();
    int bitDepth = audioFile.getBitDepth();

    int numSamples = audioFile.getNumSamplesPerChannel();
    double lengthInSeconds = audioFile.getLengthInSeconds();

    int numChannels = audioFile.getNumChannels();
    bool isMono = audioFile.isMono();
    bool isStereo = audioFile.isStereo();

    // or, just use this quick shortcut to print a summary to the console
    audioFile.printSummary();

### Access the samples directly:

    int channel = 0;
    int numSamples = audioFile.getNumSamplesPerChannel();

    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++)
    {
    	double currentSample = audioFile.samples[channel][i];
    }

### Replace the AudioFile audio buffer with another

    // 1. Create an AudioBuffer
    // (BTW, AudioBuffer is just a vector of vectors)

    AudioFile<double>::AudioBuffer buffer;

    // 2. Set to (e.g.) two channels
    buffer.resize (2);

    // 3. Set number of samples per channel
    buffer[0].resize (100000);
    buffer[1].resize (100000);

    // 4. do something here to fill the buffer with samples, e.g.

    #include <math.h> // somewhere earler (for M_PI and sinf())

    // then...

    int numChannels = 2;
    int numSamplesPerChannel = 100000;
    float sampleRate = 44100.f;
    float frequency = 440.f;

    for (int i = 0; i < numSamplesPerChannel; i++)
    {
        float sample = sinf (2. * M_PI * ((float) i / sampleRate) * frequency) ;

        for (int channel = 0; channel < numChannels; channel++)
             buffer[channel][i] = sample * 0.5;
    }

    // 5. Put into the AudioFile object
    bool ok = audioFile.setAudioBuffer (buffer);

### Resize the audio buffer

    // Set both the number of channels and number of samples per channel
    audioFile.setAudioBufferSize (numChannels, numSamples);

    // Set the number of samples per channel
    audioFile.setNumSamplesPerChannel (numSamples);

    // Set the number of channels
    audioFile.setNumChannels (numChannels);

### Set bit depth and sample rate

    audioFile.setBitDepth (24);
    audioFile.setSampleRate (44100);

### Save the audio file to disk

    // Wave file (implicit)
    audioFile.save ("path/to/desired/audioFile.wav");

    // Wave file (explicit)
    audioFile.save ("path/to/desired/audioFile.wav", AudioFileFormat::Wave);

    // Aiff file
    audioFile.save ("path/to/desired/audioFile.aif", AudioFileFormat::Aiff);

## Examples

## A Note On Types

AudioFile is a template class and so it can be instantiated using different types to represent the audio samples.

For example, we can use floating point precision...

    AudioFile<float> audioFile;

...or double precision...

    AudioFile<double> audioFile;

...or an integer type:

    AudioFile<int> audioFile;

This simply reflects the data type you would like to use to store the underlying audio samples.

When you use an integer type to store the samples (e.g. `int` or `int8_t` or `int16_t` or `uint32_t`), the library will read in the integer sample values directly from the audio file.

A couple of notes on integer types:

- The range of samples is designed to be symmetric. This means that for (e.g.) an signed 8-bit integer (`int8_t`) we will use the range `[-127, 127]` for storing samples representing the `[-1., 1.]` range. The value `-128` is possible here given the `int8_t` type, but this is interpreted as a value slightly lower than `-1` (specifically `-1.007874015748`).

- In the case of unsigned types, we obviously can't store samples as negative values. Therefore, we used the equivalent range of the unsigned type in use. E.g. if with a 8-bit signed integer (`int8_t`) the range would be `[-127, 127]`, for an 8-bit unsigned integer we would use the range `[1, 255]`. Note that we don't use `-128` for `int8_t` or `0` in `uint8_t`.

- If you try to read an audio file with a larger bit-depth than the type you are using to store samples, the attempt to read the file will fail. Put more simply, you can't read a 16-bit audio sample into an 8-bit integer.

- If you are writing audio samples in integer formats, you should use the correct sample range for both a) the type you are using to store samples; and b) the bit depth of the audio you want to write.

The following table details the sample range for each bit-depth:

| Type       | 8-bit Audio   | 16-bit Audio         | 24-bit Audio          | 32-bit Audio                |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `float`    | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]`        | `[-1.0, 1.0]`         | `[-1.0, 1.0]`               |
| `double`   | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]`        | `[-1.0, 1.0]`         | `[-1.0, 1.0]`               |
| `int8_t`   | `[-127, 127]` | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small)  | :x: (type too small)        |
| `uint8_t`  | `[1, 255]`    | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small)  | :x: (type too small)        |
| `int16_t`  | `[-127, 127]` | `[-32767, 32767]`    | :x: (type too small)  | :x: (type too small)        |
| `uint16_t` | `[1, 255]`    | `[1, 65535]`         | :x: (type too small)  | :x: (type too small)        |
| `int32_t`  | `[-127, 127]` | `[-32767, 32767]`    | [`-8388607, 8388607]` | `[-2147483647, 2147483647]` |
| `uint32_t` | `[1, 255]`    | `[1, 65535]`         | `[1, 16777215]`       | `[1, 4294967295]`           |
| `int64_t`  | `[-127, 127]` | `[-32767, 32767]`    | [`-8388607, 8388607]` | `[-2147483647, 2147483647]` |
| `uint64_t` | `[1, 255]`    | `[1, 65535]`         | `[1, 16777215]`       | `[1, 4294967295]`           |

## Error Messages

By default, the library logs error messages to the console to provide information on what has gone wrong (e.g. a file we tried to load didn't exist).

If you prefer not to see these messages, you can disable this error logging behaviour using:

    audioFile.shouldLogErrorsToConsole (false);
